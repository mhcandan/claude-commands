Run full organizational AI-readiness assessment workflow.

## Organization Assessment Workflow

Comprehensive evaluation of team, process, and metrics maturity for AI-native development.

Based on McKinsey research: Top performers use at least 3 of 5 key factors (vs 10% of bottom performers).

### Phase 1: Team Readiness Assessment

Evaluate the two key shifts:

**Shift 1: End-to-End PDLC**
- How many PDLC stages have AI at scale?
- Target: 4+ stages (leaders are 6-7x more likely to achieve this)

**Shift 2: AI-Native Roles**
- Are roles evolving? (Engineers → full-stack orchestrators, PMs → design/QA focus)
- New skills being developed?

### Phase 2: Three Enablers Evaluation

**Enabler 1: Upskilling**
- Training methods in use?
- Hands-on workshops? (57% top vs 20% bottom)
- Continuous learning embedded?

**Enabler 2: Impact Measurement**
- Tracking outcomes or just adoption?
- Quality metrics? (79% of top performers)
- Speed metrics? (57% of top performers)

**Enabler 3: Change Management**
- AI goals in performance reviews?
- Incentives tied to behaviors?
- Leadership alignment?

### Phase 3: PDLC Pipeline Audit

Assess AI integration across:
- Design/Requirements
- Coding
- Code Review
- Testing
- Deployment
- Monitoring

Identify bottlenecks in the flow.

### Phase 4: Metrics Health Check

Evaluate current measurement approach:
- Are you tracking outcomes or vanity metrics?
- Integrated tracking across tools?
- Regular reporting cadence?

### Phase 5: Gap Analysis & Roadmap

Compare to top performer benchmarks and create improvement plan.
