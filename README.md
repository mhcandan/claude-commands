## Key Concepts

### "Vibe and Verify" Framework
- **Vibe**: Generate code quickly with AI
- **Verify**: Always verify before deployment

### Four Trust Pillars
1. Explainability
2. Transparency
3. Repeatability
4. Evidence

### Performance Benchmarks (Top Performers)
- Team Productivity: 16-30% improvement
- Software Quality: 31-45% improvement
- Key threshold: 80-100% adoption → 110%+ gains
