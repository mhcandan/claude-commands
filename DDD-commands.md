# DDD Commands Reference

Five Claude Code slash commands for the [Design Driven Development](https://github.com/mhcandan/DDD) workflow.

## Overview

```
/ddd-create     Design a new project from description → YAML specs
/ddd-reverse    Reverse-engineer existing code → YAML specs
/ddd-implement  Read specs → generate code + tests
/ddd-update     Natural language → updated specs
/ddd-sync       Keep specs and code aligned
```

### Workflow

```
New project:      /ddd-create → DDD Tool → /ddd-implement → /ddd-update + /ddd-sync
Existing project: /ddd-reverse → DDD Tool → /ddd-implement → /ddd-update + /ddd-sync
```

---

## /ddd-create

Generate a complete DDD spec structure from a project description.

### Usage

```
/ddd-create <description>
```

### Examples

```
/ddd-create A SaaS platform for managing restaurant orders with users, orders, menu, and notifications domains. Tech: Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis, SendGrid.

/ddd-create A CLI tool that scrapes product prices from e-commerce sites and alerts users when prices drop. Python, FastAPI, Celery, PostgreSQL.

/ddd-create An AI-powered content moderation service with human review workflow. TypeScript, Hono, Anthropic API, PostgreSQL.
```

### What it does

1. Fetches the [DDD Usage Guide](https://github.com/mhcandan/DDD/blob/main/DDD-USAGE-GUIDE.md) from GitHub
2. Parses the description (asks clarifying questions if brief)
3. Creates full spec structure:
   - `ddd-project.json` — project config, domain list
   - `specs/system.yaml` — tech stack, environments
   - `specs/architecture.yaml` — conventions, infrastructure
   - `specs/config.yaml` — environment variables
   - `specs/shared/errors.yaml` — error codes
   - `specs/shared/types.yaml` — shared enums (if needed)
   - `specs/schemas/_base.yaml` — base model fields
   - `specs/schemas/{model}.yaml` — one per data model
   - `specs/domains/{domain}/domain.yaml` — domain config, event wiring
   - `specs/domains/{domain}/flows/{flow}.yaml` — flow graphs with nodes and connections

### Output

Shows a summary with domains, flow counts, files created, event wiring, and next steps.

---

## /ddd-reverse

Reverse-engineer an existing codebase into DDD specs.

### Usage

```
/ddd-reverse <project-path> [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--output <path>` | Where to write specs | Same as project path |
| `--domains <d1,d2>` | Only reverse specific domains | All domains |
| `--merge` | Merge with existing specs (don't overwrite) | Overwrite |
| `--strategy <name>` | Override auto-selected strategy | Auto by file count |

### Strategies

Auto-selected based on source file count (override with `--strategy`):

| Strategy | Files | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| `baseline` | < 30 | Read code directly in context |
| `index` | 30–80 | Build in-context index, process per-domain |
| `swap` | 80–150 | Write index to `.ddd/reverse/` on disk, read selectively |
| `bottom-up` | 150–300 | Grep entry points (L3), extract each independently, group into domains (L2→L1) |
| `compiler` | 300–500 | 6-pass pipeline: scan → extract → resolve → IR → link → emit |
| `codex` | 500+ | Compress codebase to ref code vocabulary + one-line call chains |

### Examples

```
# Small project (auto-selects baseline)
/ddd-reverse ~/code/my-api

# Output specs to separate folder
/ddd-reverse ~/code/my-app --output ~/code/my-app-specs

# Only reverse users and orders domains
/ddd-reverse ~/code/my-app --domains users,orders

# Add to existing specs without overwriting
/ddd-reverse ~/code/my-app --merge

# Force compiler strategy
/ddd-reverse ~/code/my-app --strategy compiler
```

### What it does

1. Detects tech stack from config files (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.)
2. Scans project structure, infers domain boundaries
3. Extracts data models from ORM/schema definitions
4. Extracts flows from routes, handlers, event listeners, cron jobs
5. Extracts cross-cutting concerns (errors, shared types, config, architecture)
6. Wires events across domains
7. Runs quality checks and coverage verification

### Output

- Complete DDD spec structure (same as `/ddd-create`)
- Coverage report at `.ddd/reverse/coverage.yaml` (file, entry point, model, event, function coverage)
- Intermediate files at `.ddd/reverse/` (resumable for swap/bottom-up/compiler/codex strategies)
- Summary with coverage percentage, warnings, and next steps

---

## /ddd-implement

Generate working code and tests from DDD specs.

### Usage

```
/ddd-implement [scope]
```

### Scope

| Argument | Scope | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `--all` | Whole project — all domains, all flows | `/ddd-implement --all` |
| `domain-name` | All flows in a domain | `/ddd-implement users` |
| `domain-name/flow-name` | Single flow | `/ddd-implement users/user-register` |
| *(empty)* | Interactive — shows flows and asks | `/ddd-implement` |

### Examples

```
# Implement everything
/ddd-implement --all

# Implement all flows in the orders domain
/ddd-implement orders

# Implement a single flow
/ddd-implement users/user-register

# Interactive mode — pick what to implement
/ddd-implement
```

### What it does

1. Finds `ddd-project.json` in current or parent directory
2. Reads all relevant specs (system, architecture, config, errors, schemas, domain, flow)
3. Checks `.ddd/mapping.yaml` for existing implementations (skip if up-to-date, update if drifted)
4. Generates code following the node graph from trigger to terminal:
   - Routes/handlers from trigger type
   - Validation from input nodes
   - DB operations from data_store nodes
   - API calls from service_call nodes
   - Branching from decision nodes
   - Event emission/consumption from event nodes
   - Agent/orchestration logic from agent nodes
5. Writes tests (happy path, branches, errors, validation)
6. Runs tests, fixes until passing
7. Updates `.ddd/mapping.yaml` with spec hash, timestamp, and file list

### Output

Summary table with domain/flow, status, file count, and test results.

---

## /ddd-update

Update DDD specs from natural language change requests.

### Usage

```
/ddd-update [scope] <description of change>
```

### Scope

| Argument | Scope | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `domain/flow` | Update a specific flow | `/ddd-update users/user-register add rate limiting` |
| `domain` | Update domain config or flows | `/ddd-update users add email verification flow` |
| `--add-flow domain` | Add a new flow to a domain | `/ddd-update --add-flow users` |
| `--add-domain` | Add a new domain | `/ddd-update --add-domain` |
| *(empty)* | Interactive — shows structure and asks | `/ddd-update` |

### Examples

```
# Modify a specific flow
/ddd-update users/user-register add rate limiting before the input node

# Add a new flow to a domain
/ddd-update --add-flow orders add a refund-order flow

# Add a new domain
/ddd-update --add-domain add a notifications domain with email and push flows

# Change a flow's behavior
/ddd-update orders/create-order add a coupon validation step before calculating total

# Interactive mode
/ddd-update
```

### What it does

1. Finds `ddd-project.json` and reads current specs
2. Parses the natural language change request
3. Modifies YAML spec files:
   - Adding/removing/modifying nodes in flows
   - Rewiring connections
   - Adding flows to domains
   - Adding domains to project
   - Updating event wiring
4. Preserves existing node IDs, positions, metadata, observability, and security configs
5. Handles cross-domain impacts (event renaming, removal warnings)
6. Validates spec integrity after changes

### Output

Shows which files changed, what was added/modified/removed in each, affected domains, and next steps (`/ddd-implement` to update code).

---

## /ddd-sync

Synchronize specs and implementation state.

### Usage

```
/ddd-sync [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| *(no flag)* | Sync `.ddd/mapping.yaml` with current implementation state |
| `--discover` | Also scan for untracked code and suggest new flow specs |
| `--fix-drift` | Re-implement flows where specs drifted from code |
| `--full` | All of the above: sync + discover + fix drift |

### Examples

```
# Basic sync — update mapping.yaml
/ddd-sync

# Find code that doesn't have specs yet
/ddd-sync --discover

# Re-implement drifted flows
/ddd-sync --fix-drift

# Everything — sync, discover, and fix
/ddd-sync --full
```

### What it does

1. Reads `.ddd/mapping.yaml` for tracked flow mappings
2. For each mapped flow:
   - Checks if implementation files still exist
   - Computes current spec hash, compares to stored hash
   - Updates file lists and timestamps
3. With `--discover`: scans `src/` for routes, services, models not mapped to any flow spec. Suggests new flow specs.
4. With `--fix-drift`: for each drifted flow (spec changed since implementation), re-implements from updated spec, runs tests, updates mapping.

### Output

Summary showing:
- Flows with up-to-date specs
- Flows with spec drift (spec changed since implementation)
- Flows with missing implementation
- (with `--discover`) Untracked code that should become flows
- (with `--fix-drift`) Flows that were re-implemented

---

## Typical Workflows

### New project from scratch

```
/ddd-create A task management app with users, projects, and tasks...
# Review in DDD Tool, adjust flows
/ddd-implement --all
```

### Existing codebase, no specs

```
/ddd-reverse ~/code/my-existing-app
# Review generated specs in DDD Tool
/ddd-implement --all   # verify round-trip
```

### Add a feature

```
/ddd-update users/user-register add email verification step after creation
/ddd-implement users/user-register
```

### Add a new domain

```
/ddd-update --add-domain add analytics domain with page-view tracking and dashboard flows
/ddd-implement analytics
```

### Code drifted from specs

```
/ddd-sync --full
# Reviews drift, re-implements, discovers untracked code
```

### Ongoing maintenance

```
/ddd-sync              # check status
/ddd-update ...        # make changes to specs
/ddd-implement ...     # update code
/ddd-sync              # verify alignment
```
